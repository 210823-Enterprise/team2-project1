# Project 1 - Custom Object Relational Mapping Framework
>***:clock2: Due Monday June 28th, 2021***

## Description

Your first team project will be to create a custom object relational mapping (ORM) framework. This framework will allow for a simplified and SQL-free interaction with the relational data source. The requires of the project are purposefully vague, the intention is to allow for you to be creative in your implementation of this framework. There are many ways that this task can be approached, and you are encouraged to explore existing Java ORM implementations in order to get some inspiration. Some suggested features that your ORM can provide are:

1. A public API that can be added as a dependency in other projects

2. File-based or programmatic configuration of entities

3. Programmatic persistence of entities (basic CRUD support)

4. Basic transaction management (begin, commit, savepoint, rollback)

5. Connection pooling

6. Lightweight session creation

7. Session-based caching to minimize calls to the database

It is encouraged that you provide clear documentation on how to use your framework in the form of a `README.md` file example [here](https://github.com/210823-Enterprise/demos/blob/main/week4/p1-sample-readme.md).

## Tech Stack
- [ ] Java 8
- [ ] JUnit a
- [ ] Apache Maven
- [ ] PostGreSQL deployed on AWS RDS
- [ ] Git SCM (on GitHub)

### Stretch Goals
- [ ] For presentation, add a web layer with servlets, and a simple user interface to demonstrate CRUD operations.
- [ ] Deploy your demo on an EC2, utilize AWS CodePipeline
- [ ] Monitor code quality with SonarCloud CI

<br>

## Init Instructions
- Create a new repository within the `210823-Enterprise` organization (naming convention: `orm_name_p1`; with `orm_name` being replaced by the name of your custom framework)

<br>

## Presentation
- [ ] Finalized version of framework must be pushed to your team repository within this organization by the presentation date (Sept. 27th, 2021)
- [ ] 10-15 minute live demonstration of the implemented features using a **demo application** to showcase the ORM's functionality
- *You will be presenting to BlackRock on Sept. 28th.*

## Team Workflow Tips
- [ ] Use a [kanban board](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards) like [Trello](https://trello.com/en-US) for task management amongst your team.
- [ ] Conduct daily [stand-up](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/standups) meetings.
